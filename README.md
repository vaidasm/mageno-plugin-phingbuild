# Magento module plugin skeleton built with phing

Phing builds *.tgz file, which you can install through "Magento Connect".
 - `package.xml` is generated
 - md5sums are generated
 - version, license and other variables can be replaced in code

To build module, just run `phing.phar dist` in root directory.

**Note**: source inside `src` is just dummy content, replace it completely if you want to use this template
